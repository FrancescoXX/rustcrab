### How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute to this repository through <i>**Issues**</i> and <i>**Pull Requests (PRs)**</i>. Before submitting your own, please search for existing Issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.

## Issues

Issues are for reporting problems with the app, requesting new features, or discussing potential changes before creating a PR.

## Assigning Issues
Ensuring Proper Assignment of Issues Before Submitting a Pull Request

When contributing to an open-source project, it's crucial to ensure that your work aligns with the project's goals and doesn't duplicate efforts. One way to achieve this is by checking whether the issue you intend to address has already been assigned to someone else. If an issue is already assigned, collaborate with the assignee to ensure efficient progress towards the same goal.

This practice helps avoid conflicts among contributors and ensures that the review process involves the right people.
**Pull requests must be linked to an assigned issue to maintain the quality and efficiency of the open-source project.**
> PRs submitted without an assigned issue will be rejected.

## Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome!

Aim to follow the existing coding style and conventions. Ensure your code is consistent with the style, formatting, and conventions used throughout the codebase.

For changes that impact core functionality or introduce breaking changes, consider opening an Issue to discuss your proposal first. While not mandatory, this can save time in creating and reviewing the changes.

### Creating a PR

This repository follows the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1. **Fork the repository to your own Github account**.

2. **Clone the project to your machine**.

3. **Create a branch locally with a concise and descriptive name**.

4. **Commit changes to the branch**.

5. **Push changes to your fork**.

6. **Open a PR in the Rustcrab repo and provide a detailed explanation of the changes you made**.


## Code Review and Feedback
1. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make changes to your PR based on the review comments.
2. Engage in discussions on the PR to clarify any questions or concerns.

## Tips For new contributors
If you are new to open source and want to contribute to this project, you can start by looking at the issues labeled as "good first issue". These issues are meant to be beginner-friendly and can be a good starting point for new contributors.

Thank you & See you around! üëã
